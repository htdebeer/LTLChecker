\chapter[Introduction]{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

This document is both a user manual for the LTL Checker plugins of the ProM
framework and a reference manual for the LTL Language. If you are only
interested in how to use the plugins, just read Chapter \ref{plugingui}. 

In that chapter, you will read about how to import your own LTL Template files
via the LTL Template Import plugin. Hereafter the most attention is on how to
start and use the Default LTL Checker plugin and the 'normal' LTL Checker
plugin. At the end of the chapter, you will see that results obtained from
using the LTL Checker plugins can be used again in the ProM framework as you
can use every log.

On the other hand, if you are interested in how to specify your own LTL
properties, you will have to read chapter \ref{language} too. That chapter
explores all the details of the LTL Language, from defining attributes to
creating complex LTL expressions. This chapter uses a simple running example
to explain all the language elements. This example is as LTL Template file and
test log file added to this manual, running.ltl and running.xml.

The last chapter contains the grammar of the LTL Language. It can be used as a
short summary of the chapter about the LTL Language, without any explanation the
structure of the language is presented.
