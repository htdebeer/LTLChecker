# The LTL Checker, a ProM framework plug-in

In 2004, as part of my Masters in Computer Science and Engineering at the
[University of Technology Eindhoven](http://www.tue.nl) (TU/e), I did an
internship at the *Information Systems* group of the *Technology and Society*
department (TeMa). This group worked on *process mining*, which is
the process of extracting valuable information from event logs that are
generated by processes. This group developed a tool in Java, called
[ProM](http://www.processmining.org/prom/start), to mine (large) XML-based
process logs.

In my internship I developed a plug-in for their ProM framework to check event logs for traces
that do or do not conform to certain properties specified in a linear temporal
logic (LTL). In LTL one can specify properties such as:

- Step X always follows step Y
- All cases valued over $45.000 are handled by manager B
- All issues created in the weekend are confirmed in two days maximum
- And so on.

For more information about this plug-in, I refer to its
[manual](Manual/LTLChecker-Manual.md) and a paper I co-authored with my supervising
professor: W.M.P. van der Aalst and H.T. de Beer and B.F. van Dongen (2005) *Process
Mining and Verification of Properties: An Approach based on Temporal Logic* ([PDF](http://www.processmining.org/_media/publications/aalst2005f.pdf)).


As both the ProM framework and the LTL Checker plug-in have been developed
further since then by others, I refer you to the latest version of the ProM framework to
try out the LTL Checker plugin: http://www.processmining.org/.
